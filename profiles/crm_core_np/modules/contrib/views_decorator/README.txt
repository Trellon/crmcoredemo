DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides a layer on top of the Views interface for registering new
handlers ready for dynamical handler extending. It's an API module designed to
be used by other modules to ease the implementation of the Decorator module for
achieving "horizontal extensibility" in Views. It takes care only of the interface
and lets the code alone to be cooked by the Decorator module.

So it does nothing on it own. If you're not a developer, don't install this module
unless another module tells you to.
