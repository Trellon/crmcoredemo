UPGRADING FROM 1.x TO 2.x
-------------------------

Sorry, but there is no upgrade path between the 1.x version of Homebox and the 2.x version.
In order for Homebox 2 to work correctly, you must completely uninstall any previous versions
and cleanly install this version.


NEW FEATURES
------------

Homebox 2 is loaded with new features and improvements. To get the most out of this module,
please quickly read the list of changes in CHANGELOG.txt, under the 2.x section.


CONTROLLING ACCESS TO HOME BOX PAGES
------------------------------------

Access controls for Homebox pages (not the admin interface) are no longer located in the standard
Drupal permissions table. When creating/editing each Homebox page, you can choose which roles are
allowed to view the page. Unlike other Drupal components, if you do not choose any roles, then only
admins can view the page. So, choose at least one role. For obvious reasons, anonymous users will
not be able to save pages or add custom items.


CREATING PANELS-LIKE HOME BOX LAYOUTS
-------------------------------------

One of Homebox 2's new features, is the ability to easily create panels-like layouts. After creating
a new Homebox page, click the 'Settings' link. Under the 'Custom column widths' fieldset, you can
specify the width percentage of each region. If you wanted to create a layout like:

[-----top----]
[--l--][--r--]
[---bottom---]

You'd use widths of 100, 50, 50, and 100.


"CUSTOM ITEMS"
--------------

Another new feature in Homebox 2 is the ability for users to enter custom items into their Homebox.
Each Homebox page has the option to turn this on or off. If set on, users can enter as many custom
blocks as they like - supplying a block title and body (full HTML allowed). This is useful if they want
to paste code for an external widget.


PROFILE INTEGRATION
-------------------

Homebox 2 integrates with Drupal's core profile module. After creating a page, you can navigate
to admin/user/homebox and choose any available Homebox page to reside as a tab on user's profiles.
User's can only view their own Homebox profile tab.


ORGANIC GROUPS INTEGRATION
--------------------------

Similar to the previously mentioned, Homebox integrates with the Organic Groups module. You have the option
to have a Homebox page reside as a group homepage tab, or become the new group homepage itself. You must
enable the homebox_og module then navigate to admin/og/homebox. If your site is using Panels and you set
a Homebox page to act as a group homepage, it will automatically disable any Panels that override node
views.


FEATURES INTEGRATION
--------------------

Homebox 2 has the ability to import and export pages, as well as have them live in code. Because of this,
Homebox has been made to integrate with the Features.module. For more information about Features, please
visit http://drupal.org/project/features.


API
---

Modules can now ship with a Homebox completely in code. See homebox_example.module for an example and
documentation.
